## Enhancement #1
Pots can store up to 99 items.

## Enhancement #2
Pots keep their contents when broken without a tool.

Use them like a shulker box that can only store 1 item type.

## Enhancement #3
Pots with gunpowder explode when shot with a flaming arrow or lit with flint and steel.

The size of the explosion is determined by the amount of gunpowder in the pot.

## Enhancement #4
Put flowers, saplings, or mushrooms in pots to display them.
